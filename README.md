After years of working hard to rise through the ranks of the empire?s merchant marine, she?s finally become first lieutenant on an interstellar cargo vessel.When her captain dies under suspicious circumstances, Virika is arrested for murder and charged with treason despite her lifelong loyalty to the empire.
